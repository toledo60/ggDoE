#' Reflectance Data, Pulp Experiment
#'
#' Plant performance is based on pulp brightness as measured by a reflectance meter.
#' Each of the four shift operators (denoted by A, B, C, and D) made five pulp handsheets from unbleached pulp.
#' Reflectance was read for each of the handsheets using a brightness tester

#' @format A tibble with 5 rows, and 4 variables (A,B,C,D)
